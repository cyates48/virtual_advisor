// Ideal responses
When loading into the webapp, user should be presented with a text box where they input their major
Front-end "slides/transforms' into the schedule + list design
From here, the schedule + lists are populated, displayed, and ready for user to interact with
To move classes within the schedule, user should ideally be able drag'n'drop
    The same could apply to the list elements
        Not sure how much different it would be from doing it for the schedule, but lower priority in case of time restriction
        


// Possible JS frameworks -- useful for designing/modifying the front-end

// Creation
Create a 3x4 table (3 quarters, 4 years)
First implementation of lists don't need to be collapsable, just capable of displaying data
    Should still be somewhat visuall appearling
Each item in a box in the schedule should have four areas (to place classes)
Each of these areas should be an object
Stuff from the lists should also be objects
    This is to add event handlers needed for interaction
