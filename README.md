# virtual_advisor

Creating a virtual advisor to help put together a 4-year college plan.

Partners: Christopher Yates, Ilyas Reyhanoglu, Manuel Munguia

We strive to create a project that is more than a simple schedule maker.
Instead, we not only allow for schedule creation and organization, but
also provide feedback to users as if they were speaking with a real
advisor. This is intended to help students have an easier time when
planning their schedule and to increase producitivity. This also helps
advisors know that students can at least semi-reliably create their
own schedules in their own time.
